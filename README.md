# Howdy, I'm Sung!

## Why read me?

I'm writing this in the hope that we can fast forward through some getting-to-know-you facets of me that we might miss (of course doing so IRL is better, but not always possible).

I am really keen to do great work with/for you and I can be extremely, extraordinarily creative and productive under the right conditions.

I am also very imperfect and I hope that my transparency about them here is not treated as an excuse for my flaws but as a guide for you to know how I might fail. Consider this an open invite for you to call me out and prevent bigger pain down the road.

## My role

- Consider adding a slalom build job description here

## TL;DR

- add quick bits of career journey and milestones
- certifications aren't everything, building real, living, useful things are the way to go

## What I Believe In

1. **Learning by Building**: I'm a big proponent that hands-on, tangible work reveals skill and growth more than lectures and certifications by themselves. In the past, I would limit myself in thinking academic technical knowledge around a topic equated to being ready to deploy something production worthy on day one. I thought I had to create the same POC everyone creates on their first Medium blog post to show, "Hey, I'm an engineer internet stranger! Validate me!" I thought filling my resume with the just the right recipe of buzzwords so as to pass through recruiting software keyword filters but human enough for a recruiter's glance was enough. Old me used proxies to being a better engineer without actually working to become a better engineer. Having is not the same as being. Appearances are the not same as being. I'm way more interested in journeying with myself and with you in building meaningful experiences and tools that actually work rather than stroking my ego on a pet project that validates the old me.

1. **It's not about getting what people usually want, it's about surpassing who I am**: It's taken a lot of hard conversations with myself, community, and mentors to awaken a drive to chase after being a growing person rather than prestige, golden handcuffs, and corporate ladders. I strongly advocate for projects/work that grow me into the person I want to become, not what will be bureaucratically advantageous. Titles as an incentive for doing work incongruent with my career vision will not motivate me. I thrive in hands-on work, not powerpoints(see point 1 above).

## Accountability

The general thrust of this is: lets agree upon what we need done and why (I'll always have a suggestion), enable me with resources and knowledge, and check in frequently while I throw myself at it.

1. **Start with Why**: I generally (but don't literally) believe in [asking 5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) and will often question why we are doing a thing as it may not be the best way of achieving our ultimate intended goal.
2. **Frequent, Specific Deliverables**: I work best when I know exactly what is expected of me. I'm also a sprinter and will move heaven and earth to deliver something I've signed up to deliver.
3. **Stretch**: I have no problem signing up for things slightly out of my comfort zone and knowledge level, in fact I love the challenge and do my best work on the edge. I'm willing to go to the second tab of a google search. That's some due diligence right there.

## How I Work

- **How should people set time with you?** I prefer slack for conversations that take 2-3 minutes. If it's something 4-10 minutes, let's pickup the phone in real-time. It minimizes a lot of back and forth, and tone and subtext show a bit more. For anything longer I keep my calendar updated regularly, so slap something on a reasonable time window!

- **What's the best way to discuss issues with you?** I am open to real-time conversations about work quality and/or interpersonal working dynamics. I welcome you to setup time 1:1 with me and a heads up and/or tap me on the shoulder and ask if we can discuss something in that moment. I ask that you name behaviors and end results from me that you challenge because it'll be something measurable I can act on rather than a nebulous character judgment.

- **How do you define "Done"?** My bar for "done" is probably lower than yours (see "Learn in Public", above). But I also expect to work on things after they are "initially done", i.e. I probably see more stages to a task than most. I do not put documentation at the end of my process so much as use it as a planning and support tool while I code, but having good docs are very much part of how I define "Done". Tests are great, but only make sense if there is stability in the API/idea so it is more of a judgment call for me than some who want everything unit tested.

- **When are you available?** Chicago timezone. If you want, we can work through: [calendly](https://calendly.com/)

## Personality quirks

- I am a enthusiastic extrovert. I grew up as a chubby, unpopular boy, so I was forced to work on my personality growing up. It paid dividends many times over :)

## [Known Failure Modes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1df5MALZKZU6lOeIXUiO-h6ReFM3KuIpnapSE97IZnX4/edit#slide=id.p)

- I shut down when people are bikeshedding (spending disproportionate time debating small things that they know well while not discussing bigger things that really matter). Yes, what "really matters" is subjective. But I will pick silence over contributing to what I perceive as noise. If it really does matter and you see me shut off, please tell me why it matters (see 5 Whys). I may respond by pointing to the bigger thing that does matter in my view.
- I've been accused of being too direct with people without context. I don't like smalltalk and while I respect that there I things I don't know, I often implicitly assume that people will fill me in on what I need to know if they see me assuming things in error. This can be a bad assumption.
- Because "my bar for done is probably lower than yours" (see above) it can appear like I don't care about details. I care (watch how rarely I make grammatical/spelling mistakes) but I care -more- about getting things out and iterating on the big picture first rather than debating wording on a button. Obviously, a lot more cases in real life are more ambiguous than that. If I make a judgement error and the detail really does matter, please call me out on it and I will work with you.
- _This is a non exhaustive list; There are definitely more things I can't think of right now._

# Misc

This idea comes from [Manager README's](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe) - I'm no manager but I like the idea of READMEs to accelerate getting-to-know-you phases, especially asynchronously. So I'm trying this out.

I forked this README from another great example.

This is a living document, and I can't wait to show you my new commits along the way :)
