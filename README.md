# Howdy, I'm Sung!

## Why read me?

I'm writing this because I was inspired by the template readme I'm basing this off of to expedite some "get to know me" dimensions. I prefer face to face, but I know I work with remote teams where we don't get the chance to fully expand on what I'm sharing throughout this document.

I love building great work together when the problem context and my personal working posture align.

I am a work in progress just like you who is reading this now, and I name and claim what's written below. My motto is being "humble and hungry", and I hope you join alongside me as we grow together in that.

## My role

- Consider adding a slalom build job description here

## TL;DR

- add quick bits of career journey and milestones
- certifications aren't everything, building real, living, useful things are the way to go

## What I Believe In

1. **Learning by Building**: I'm a big proponent that hands-on, tangible work reveals skill and growth more than lectures and certifications by themselves. In the past, I would limit myself in thinking academic technical knowledge around a topic equated to being ready to deploy something production worthy on day one. I thought I had to create the same POC everyone creates on their first Medium blog post to show, "Hey, I'm an engineer internet stranger! Validate me!" I thought filling my resume with the just the right recipe of buzzwords so as to pass through recruiting software keyword filters but human enough for a recruiter's glance was enough. Old me used proxies to being a better engineer without actually working to become a better engineer. Having is not the same as being. Appearances are the not same as being. I'm way more interested in journeying with myself and with you in building meaningful experiences and tools that actually work rather than stroking my ego on a pet project that validates the old me.

1. **It's not about getting what people usually want, it's about surpassing who I am**: It's taken a lot of hard conversations with myself, community, and mentors to awaken a drive to chase after being a growing person rather than prestige, golden handcuffs, and corporate ladders. I strongly advocate for projects/work that grow me into the person I want to become, not what will be bureaucratically advantageous. Titles as an incentive for doing work incongruent with my career vision will not motivate me. I thrive in hands-on work, not powerpoints(see point 1 above).

## Accountability

The general thrust of this is: let's agree upon what we need done and why (I'll always have a suggestion), enable me with resources and knowledge, and check in frequently while I throw myself at it.

1. **Start with Why**: I generally believe in articulating the core story underlying the problem we're solving. If it can't be named in plain language, then I can't imagine the end result will resonate with the end user. The upfront work can be cumbersome, and I do see the art in discerning whether we're brainstorming or going into analysis paralysis. However, I like doing my best to avoid building a rocket when we need a boat or worse vice versa.

2. **Frequent, Specific Deliverables**: I work best when I know exactly what is expected of me, and you'll notice me repeat next steps back to you. I believe words are precious, and I'll be as honest as possible about when I can deliver something: [Wise Words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uUAUDGl5-U&feature=youtu.be&t=34)

3. **[Ultimate Tensile Strength](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensile_strength)**: I thrive in jumping into the deep end, and I love the challenge of building things that haven't been Medium blogged to death. I'm willing to go to the second tab of a Google search to figure things out. That's some due diligence right there.

## How I Work

- **How should people set time with you?** I prefer slack for conversations that take 2-3 minutes. If it's something 4-10 minutes, let's pickup the phone in real-time. It minimizes a lot of back and forth, and tone and subtext show a bit more. For anything longer I keep my calendar updated regularly, so slap something on a reasonable time window!

- **What's the best way to discuss issues with you?** I am open to real-time conversations about work quality and/or interpersonal working dynamics. I welcome you to setup time 1:1 with me and a heads up and/or tap me on the shoulder and ask if we can discuss something in that moment. I ask that you name behaviors and end results from me that you challenge because it'll be something measurable I can act on rather than a nebulous character judgment.

- **How do you define "Done"?** I typically list a bunch of internal acceptance criteria and get through 80% of that list before sharing my results with the rest of team. My aim is to show the team I'm pulling my weight but open to feedback and pivoting if I'm missing the mark before I get too emotionally attached to my 100% done definition. Documentation and testing are built into my definition of done but don't expect every edge case under the sun to be accounted for in the first draft. My ethos is that there is no final done, just better and better drafts.

- **When are you available?** Chicago timezone. If you want, we can work through: [calendly](https://calendly.com/)

## Personality quirks

- I am a enthusiastic extrovert. I grew up as a chubby, unpopular boy, so I was forced to work on my personality growing up. It paid dividends many times over :)

## [Known Failure Modes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1df5MALZKZU6lOeIXUiO-h6ReFM3KuIpnapSE97IZnX4/edit#slide=id.p)

- I shut down when people are bikeshedding (spending disproportionate time debating small things that they know well while not discussing bigger things that really matter). Yes, what "really matters" is subjective. But I will pick silence over contributing to what I perceive as noise. If it really does matter and you see me shut off, please tell me why it matters (see 5 Whys). I may respond by pointing to the bigger thing that does matter in my view.
- I've been accused of being too direct with people without context. I don't like smalltalk and while I respect that there I things I don't know, I often implicitly assume that people will fill me in on what I need to know if they see me assuming things in error. This can be a bad assumption.
- Because "my bar for done is probably lower than yours" (see above) it can appear like I don't care about details. I care (watch how rarely I make grammatical/spelling mistakes) but I care -more- about getting things out and iterating on the big picture first rather than debating wording on a button. Obviously, a lot more cases in real life are more ambiguous than that. If I make a judgement error and the detail really does matter, please call me out on it and I will work with you.
- _This is a non exhaustive list; There are definitely more things I can't think of right now._

# Misc

This idea comes from [Manager README's](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe) - I'm no manager but I like the idea of READMEs to accelerate getting-to-know-you phases, especially asynchronously. So I'm trying this out.

I forked this README from another great example.

This is a living document, and I can't wait to show you my new commits along the way :)
